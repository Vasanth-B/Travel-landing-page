I began by building the landing page structure with HTML, carefully organizing each section. Then, I styled the page using CSS, ensuring it was both visually appealing and responsive. After finalizing the design, I tested the page to confirm everything was working correctly. Finally, I uploaded the HTML and CSS code to GitHub for easy access.
